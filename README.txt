This repository houses the code and images for my Clean HR Data 12.30.25 data qualitly project. In this project I explore, clean, and standardize HR data. I use SQL to validate the data by checking for missing values, duplicates, out-of-range values, incorrect formats, and inconsistencies in the data.   I also check for referential integrity and business rule validation.
